  title: "Who am I?"
  content: >
    <p>TL;DR: I thrive on learning, and love to share what I learn with others!</p>

    <p>I'm a coffee nerd that loves to share beautiful cups of coffee with everyone! I've been working my way into the coffee industry ever since I was a 2023 AeroPress World Championship contender, and got to visit Melbourne, Australia. This trip made me realise how much I love coffee, and how little I still know about it and the industry surrounding it.</p>

    <p>For this reason, I've started to look for opportunities to get involved, which got me doing barista service, workshops, coffee tastings, and roasting coffee.</p>

      content: "Cold calling can be a great way to generate quality leads. You get to speak to the gatekeepers and stakeholders, and you get a great insight into their requirements and influences. But cold calling is an art-form. It can be daunting, it’s always a lot of work, and you always need to make a good impression."
